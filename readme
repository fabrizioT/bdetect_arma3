WHAT IS IT
---------------------------------------------

It's a small SP (Single Player) framework in form of single .sqf file, named "bdetect.sqf". Basic scripting knowledge required.
It was made in order to easily detect any flying bullets close to infantrymen, given some basic configuration (See: CONFIGURATION).
Once a bullet is found being closer enough to some unit, a custom callback function is called: it's up to you defining the contents of this callback function.

HOW TO RUN IT
---------------------------------------------

Running bDetect is straightforward if you have some basic knowledge of .sqf scripting. 
There are 5 simple required steps, to be executed from within your own .sqf script file:

* Load "bdetect.sqf"  from within your own script. Put "bdetect.sqf" into your mission folder and call it from there.
* Set any bDetect variables you wish having values different than default.
* Set bDetect "bdetect_callback" special variable: it holds the name of your own callback function, which will be executed on a per-unit basis when a bullet is detected close.
* Declare your own callback function, named as "bdetect_callback", and define its payload. Make function as simple, fast and compact as possible.
* Initialize bDetect and wait for completion.

Other stuff is optional.
